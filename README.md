# CS-250 Portfolio: Sprint Review & Retrospective

This repo holds my final Sprint Review & Retrospective for the SNHU Travel app project. You’ll find the write-up in `Sprint_Review_Retrospective.docx`.

** Reflective Answers**

**1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program?**  
It starts with careful listening to what stakeholders (and customers) really want. User stories then become a clear checklist who it’s for, what they need, and why it matters. In the Top 5 Destinations slideshow, Christy’s stories (“As a traveler, I want to scroll through five top spots”) drove which images, captions, and controls were built. When any story felt vague, a quick clarifying question prevented guesswork and ensured the team delivered exactly what was required.

**2. How do I approach developing programs?**  
Large projects get broken into bite sized tasks add one picture, write one test, tweak one caption and each sprint delivers a working slice. That steady cadence, paired with mini demos and immediate feedback, kept the team on track and made pivots smooth. Going forward, short sprints, daily stand-ups, and continuous integration will remain core practices; they transform “too many meetings” into just right checkpoints and make every demo feel like a small victory.

**3. What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?**  
Being a good teammate means sharing knowledge, asking for help when stuck, and keeping everyone informed. During this project, that looked like pairing on tricky code, updating Trello with clear progress notes, and flagging blockers in quick stand-ups instead of letting issues pile up in email. It’s not about always knowing the answer—it’s about creating an environment where it’s safe to say “this needs work” and suggest a better path forward.
